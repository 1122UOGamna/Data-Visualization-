# 📊 Data Visualizations

Welcome to the **Data Visualizations** repository! This project showcases a wide range of visual representations that bring data to life—transforming raw numbers into clear, insightful, and compelling stories.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository is a collection of my data visualization projects using various tools and libraries. It serves as both a personal learning archive and a resource for others interested in the art and science of visualizing data.

## 📌 Highlights

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plots
- Interactive dashboards
- Time series visualizations
- Correlation heatmaps
- Geospatial data plots
- Custom styling and themes for visual storytelling

## 🛠 Technologies & Libraries

- **Python**
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `plotly`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for clean and interactive presentation
- Occasionally: `Tableau`, `Power BI`, or other external tools (if applicable)

 Goals & Future Plans
I'm always looking for new ways to visualize and interpret data. Future plans include:

Building interactive dashboards using Streamlit or Dash

Real-time data visualizations with APIs

Advanced 3D and animated charts

Domain-specific visualizations (e.g., healthcare, finance)
